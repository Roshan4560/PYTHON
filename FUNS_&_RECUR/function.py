# FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON
# Functions are two types :
# 1. Built-in functions : These are the functions which are already defined in python.
#    Example : print(), input(), len(), type(), etc.
# 2. User-defined functions : These are the functions which are defined by the user.
#    Example : def fun_name(param1, param2):
#             some work : return value
